# Practice Problems

Practice problems are designed as short exercises for people
who want to practice a little and gain some confidence in that
they've mastered the week's material before tackling the
homework. How are those different from homework assignments?

1. Practice problems are ungraded.
2. Test suites and solutions are avalable.
3. Solutions can be discussed on the forums (but please put a
**SPOILER ALERT** up front).
4. Practice problems are simpler and easier than the homework
problems.
5. There's no unifying theme to a given practice problem set,
those are just collections of unrelated tasks.

To gain the most out of practice problems, we recommend to
approach them in exactly the same way you would work on your
graded assignments -- that is, without looking at solutions or
provided tests.
